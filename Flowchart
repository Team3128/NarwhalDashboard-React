Going from big to small:

1. Index.js
    - Responsible for rendering the overall robot page and ultimately "App"
    - Index.css: styling for the index page (not really needed)

2. App.js
    - Includes Nav Bar for all TABS + Enable/Disable Button
    - Loads all the COMPONENTS that are avaliable for use

3. TABS:
    - Home (Main Tab for Driveteam) -> App.js
    - Debug (Constants) -> /Tabs/debug.js
    - Log File (TEXTFILE FOR CHARGED UP SEASON) -> /Tabs/log.js
    - Field (Live view of Robot on Field) -> /Tabs/field.js

4. CURRENT COMPONENTS (2022-2023: CHARGED UP):
    - Clock/Timer (/Components/timer.js)
    - Scoring Grid (/Components/grid.js)
    - Auto Chooser (/Components/auto.js)
